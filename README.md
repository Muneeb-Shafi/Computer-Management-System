"# Computer-Management-System" 
It is a simple software built for the management of an Internet cafe
The software blocks all kind of pc usage without an account to be logged in with
The software monitors total time usage and deletes all user data after logout
Admin can add new users via admin panel, add more credits, disable user accounts 
Users can sigunp and buy credits->> Hours to use pc for specific time

The system uses Online Database hosting to save all the users and admin data

Available Modules are 
->>>> User and Admin Login
->>>> Time Calculations
->>>> Add users and Time
->>>> Delete and Update users 
->>>> View all active users



Just download the source code, compile the solution, add reference to your Online DB host and Build 

PS----- Keep a Backup plan to close the app as you will be totally locked out of the pc once the app starts
I will upload the DB Tables soon for your own Database
